# A-CLIP--MLP-Pipeline-for-Real-vs-Synthetic-Image-Detection
This repository contains the official implementation of the paper **"Speeding Up AI Image Forensics: A CLIP-MLP Pipeline for Real vs. Synthetic Detection"**.\ The project introduces a lightweight, efficient, and highly accurate framework for detecting AI-generated images using frozen **CLIP ViT-L/14 embeddings** and a compact **MLP classifier**.
